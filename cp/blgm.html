<p>This is an old usaco bronze problem that I found through usaco.guide.</p>
<p>This problem is rather long like all usaco problems, so <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=664">here</a>&#39;s a link so you can read it.</p>
<p>This problem is a great reminder of why you should slow down and look for the easiest attempt and not the first one that you think of. USACO tricks you by listing all possibilities   of the board in the output explanation. This led me to think that the easiest way to solve the problem was to use recursive backtracking to find every possible combination of words and then figure out how many letters I needed. However, this becomes an awful approach once you realize that only one of the two words can be shown at a time. The fact that this is true means that we can simply go through all the letters in both given words and add the maximum number of occurrences for each letter in the 2 given words to our answers. If we do this for all blocks it will yield the minimum number of blocks needed. Here&#39;s the code for this problem: </p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; n; i++)
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> word1, word2;
    <span class="hljs-built_in">cin</span> &gt;&gt; word1 &gt;&gt; word2;
    <span class="hljs-built_in">vector</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>&gt; freq1(<span class="hljs-number">26</span>), freq2(<span class="hljs-number">26</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> c : word1)
    {
        freq1[c - <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>]++;
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> c : word2)
    {
        freq2[c - <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>]++;
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i =  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="hljs-number">26</span>; i++)
    {
        ans[i] += max(freq1[i], freq2[i]);
    }
}
