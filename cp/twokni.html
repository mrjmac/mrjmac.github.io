<p>This is the seventh problem in the CSES competitive programming problem set.</p>
<p>The problem goes like this: given an k x k chessboard, determine the number of ways that two knights can be placed on a chessboard so that they don&#39;t attack each other.</p>
<p>This problem is pretty daunting at first glance, at I struggled with my approach at first. I had no idea how to simulate it or anything like that, so I broke the problem down. The first thing we have to consider is how many ways that knights can be placed on a board regardless of if the position is &quot;safe&quot; or not. This was fairly easy. One knight can be placed on every square, which we can define as K^2. So if the chessboard is size k = 5, he can be placed in 25 positions. The second knight can also occupy any space on the chessboard as long as the first one isn&#39;t in it. We can define this as (K^2) - 1. Because for every position that the second knight can be placed in, the first knight can be placed in K^2 more, we can find the total number of squares that they fit in as (K^2) * ((K^2) - 1). </p>
<p>However the problem treats the two knights as identical, and this equation does not account for that. This means that if the first knight and the second knight swap positions, our current equation would treat that as a new position. To fix this, we just need to divide the total number of spots by 2. This makes sense as for every non swapped position, a swapped one will always exists. This leaves us with the equation ((K^2) * ((K^2) - 1)) / 2.</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is subtract all the positions where the two knights can take each other. This can be defined pretty easily, and I&#39;ll use a visual to demonstrate.</p>

<p>As you can see, this in image we see that all knights fit in a 2 * 3 square grid when they are able to take each other. They are unable to take each other in all but one other formation, which we&#39;ll get to later. All we need to do is figure out how many 2 by 3 square grids there are in a chessboard of size k.</p>

<p>As you can see in the above image, the formation requires two squares on the X axis. Therefore, it will fit in all X positions until the last one. We can define number of formations that exist as k - 1. </p>

<p>As you can see in the above image, the formation requires three squares on the Y axis. Therefore, it will fit in all Y positions until the last two. We can define the number of formations that exist then as k - 2.</p>
<p>By multiplying k - 2 by k - 1, we find the total number of 2 x 3 grids on the board. However, for each 2 x 3 grid, there are two positions in which the knights can take each other. Additionally, knights can also take each other in 3 x 2 grids. However, as the board is a square there are the same number of 3 x 2 grids as there are 2 x 3 grids. In order to account for both of these issues, we multiply our equation by 4. Our final equation for the number of places where two knights cannot be is (4 * (K - 1) * (K - 2)). Finally, we can subtract this from our starting equation to get a final equation of (((K^2) * ((K^2) - 1)) / 2) - (4 * (K - 1) * (K - 2)). Here&#39;s the code for this problem:</p>

        }
