<p>This is an old usaco bronze problem that I found through usaco.guide.</p>
<p>This problem is rather long like all usaco problems, so <a href="http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=1228">here</a>&#39;s a link so you can read it.</p>
<p>This problem seems pretty complicated at first glance. Initially you would assume that you should check how many people would be lying for every position possible on pi, however this is not possible due to time constraints. The answer is actually pretty simple when you really get into it though. The key thing is to first sort all values of pi. This is very important later. In order to preserve the sign of the guess after we sort this, we can store our input in a pair. Now all that we have to do is loop through and check how many contradictory statements there are from each cow. Here's the code for this problem: </p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;pair&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">char</span>&gt;&gt; cows(<span class="hljs-built_in">n</span>);
for (<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="hljs-built_in">n</span>; i++)
{
    cin &gt;&gt; cows[i].<span class="hljs-built_in">second</span> &gt;&gt; cows[i].first;
}

sort(cows.begin(), cows.end());

vector&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">left</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">n</span>);
vector&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">right</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">n</span>);

for (<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt; <span class="hljs-built_in">n</span>; i++)
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">left</span>[i] += <span class="hljs-built_in">left</span>[i - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>];

    <span class="hljs-built_in">if</span> (cows[i - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>].<span class="hljs-built_in">second</span> == 'L' &amp;&amp; cows[i].first &gt; cows[i - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>].first)
    {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">left</span>[i] += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    }
}

for (<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-built_in">n</span> - <span class="hljs-number">2</span>; i &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i--)
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">right</span>[i] += <span class="hljs-built_in">right</span>[i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>];

    <span class="hljs-built_in">if</span> (cows[i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>].<span class="hljs-built_in">second</span> == 'G' &amp;&amp; cows[i].first &lt; cows[i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>].first)
    {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">right</span>[i] += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    }
}

for(<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="hljs-built_in">n</span>; i++)
{
    ans = <span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(ans, <span class="hljs-built_in">left</span>[i] + <span class="hljs-built_in">right</span>[i]);
}

    cout &lt;&lt; ans &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>;
