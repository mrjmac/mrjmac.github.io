<p><a href="https://github.com/mrjmac/competitive-programming/blob/main/CSES/coinPiles.java">GitHub link</a></p>
<p>This is the eleventh problem in the CSES problem set.</p>
<p>The problem goes like this: You have two coin piles containing a and b coins. On each move, you can either remove one coin from the left pile and two coins from the right pile, or two coins from the left pile and one coin from the right pile. Figure out if you can empty both piles.</p>
<p>This problem is a lot easier than it seems. The first thing I noticed is that it will always be impossible the empty the stack if one if more than twice as big as the other. This is because even if you opt to remove 2 coins from the biggest stack on every turn, the other stack will be emptied too fast. </p>
<p>To figure out what other rule I could use to check if piles could be emptied, I filled the piles from 0 instead of emptying them. Here were the possibilities I came up with:</p>
<p>1 2</p>
<p>3 3</p>
<p>2 4</p>
<p>I noticed after writing these possibilities down that no matter how I add coins to the piles, 3 coins are being added overall. Therefore, if a given pile meets the first rule in the above paragraph and is divisible by 3, the pile can be emptied. Here&#39;s the code for this problem:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">if</span> (a &gt; b)
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">if</span> (b * <span class="hljs-number">2</span> &lt; a)
    {
        pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"NO"</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-built_in">else</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">if</span> ((a + b) % <span class="hljs-number">3</span> == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
    {
        pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"YES"</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-built_in">else</span> {
        pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"NO"</span>);
    }
}
<span class="hljs-built_in">else</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">if</span> (a * <span class="hljs-number">2</span> &lt; b)
    {
        pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"NO"</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-built_in">else</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">if</span> ((a + b) % <span class="hljs-number">3</span> == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
    {
        pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"YES"</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-built_in">else</span> {
        pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"NO"</span>);
    }
}
