<p>This is an old usaco bronze problem that I found through usaco.guide.</p>
<p>The problem is rather long like all usaco problems, so <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=855">here</a>&#39;s a link so you can read it.</p>
<p>This problem is extremely trivial. As N is limited to 100, we can easily simulate every pour within the time limit. The index of the current bucket will be equal to i % 3. At first I added 1 to this index in order to access the bucket after it, however I realized this was wrong before I even tested my code. In the event of i == 2, we would try to access an index out of bounds with this setup. Instead, the index of the second bucket can be found by doing (i + 1) % 3. After we have our indexes, we just have to pour the most milk possible into the next bucket. This is equal to lower of the limit of the 2nd bucket minus the current amount of milk in the second bucket and the amount of milk in the first bucket. Here&#39;s the code for this problem</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-type">vector</span>&lt;int&gt; limits(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>);
<span class="hljs-type">vector</span>&lt;int&gt; buckets(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>);

cin &gt;&gt; limits[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] &gt;&gt; buckets[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] &gt;&gt; limits[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] &gt;&gt; buckets[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] &gt;&gt; limits[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>] &gt;&gt; buckets[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]; 

for (int i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="hljs-number">100</span>; i++)
{
    int pos = i % <span class="hljs-number">3</span>;
    int pos2 = (i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) % <span class="hljs-number">3</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// prevent out of bounds index</span>
    int milk = min(buckets[pos], limits[pos2] - buckets[pos2]);
    buckets[pos] -= milk;
    buckets[pos2] += milk;
}

for (int i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; (int)limits.size(); i++)
{
   cout &lt;&lt; buckets[i] &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-subst">\n</span>"</span>; 
}
