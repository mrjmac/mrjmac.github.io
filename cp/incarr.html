<p>This is the fourth problem in the CSES competitive programming problem set.</p>
<p>The problem goes like this: You are given an array of n integers. This array is not in order and you want to modify the array to be increasing. On each move you can increase the value of any element by one. Find the minimum number of moves required so that the array is in increasing order.</p>
<p>This problem is pretty straight forward. The method that I used to solve this problem was adding the difference between the current number and the number before it to the move counter. Then I made sure to set the value of the new previous, or old current number, to the value of the old previous number as they should be equal now. Here&#39;s the code for this problem:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (st.hasMoreTokens())
{
    curr = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (curr &lt; <span class="hljs-keyword">last</span>)
    {
        moves += <span class="hljs-keyword">last</span> - curr;
        curr = <span class="hljs-keyword">last</span>;
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">last</span> = curr;
}
pw.println(moves);
