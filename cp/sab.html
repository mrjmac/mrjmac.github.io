<p>This is an introductory codeforces problem that I found through usaco.guide.</p>
<p>The problem goes like this: A soldier wants to buy w bananas in the shop. He has to pay k dollars for the first banana, 2k dollars for the second one and so on (in other words, he has to pay iÂ·k dollars for the i-th banana). He has n dollars. How many dollars does he have to borrow from his friend soldier to buy w bananas?</p>
<p>This problem is extremely basic. All we need to do is find the sum of 1 to w and multiply the base cost of a banana by that value. To do this, we can use the summation formula: w * (w + 1) / 2. </p>
<p>The reason why this works is because (4 * 1) + (4 * 2) is the same as 4 * 3, because you are adding 3 4s together. Then all we have to do is take the max of the total cost minus how much money the soldier starts with and 0. Here&#39;s the code for this problem:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">long</span> cost = w * (w + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) / <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
cost *= k;
pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(Math.<span class="hljs-built_in">max</span>(cost - n, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>));
pw.<span class="hljs-built_in">close</span>();
