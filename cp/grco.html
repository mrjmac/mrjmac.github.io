<p>This is the thirteenth problem in the CSES problem set.</p>
<p>The problem goes like this: A Gray code is a list of all 2n bit strings of length n, where any two successive strings differ in exactly one bit (i.e., their Hamming distance is one). Create a Gray code for a given length n.</p>
<p>My first two approaches to this problem were completely wrong. I assumed that consecutive numbers in binary would have a hamming distance of 1. This is clearly not the case and I would&#39;ve noticed this had I thought a little harder. </p>
<p>After unsuccessfully looking for a pattern between binary strings with consecutive hamming distances, I realized that there wasn&#39;t one. I decided that the first step to this problem was to figure out how to generate all binary strings on length n in an efficient manner. My initial plan was to generate the strings and then sort them, however I realized that this wouldn&#39;t be necessary when I figured out how to efficiently generate all the strings. Back when I was solving the problem <a href="https://mrjmac.github.io/cp/bitstr.html">Bit Strings</a>, I realized that each new digit in binary can interact with all previous combinations of digits as either a 1 or a 0. I drew out this method of generating each new binary number in order to visualize how I could sort it.</p>

<p>I noticed that due to the nature of this generation algorithm, it is extremely easy to order the new numbers so that they have a hamming distance of 1. The nth value of each list on the right side are each 1 bit apart. This makes sense, as our generation method takes a value from the previous list and creates two values that have a hamming distance of one from each other. In order for this algorithm to work, the list that I generated the new values off of had to already be a gray code. Thankfully the array[0, 1] meets this requirement. Here&#39;s the method I wrote for this problem:</p>
<pre><code>public <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> void add(<span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>[] a, <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> n, PrintWriter pw, <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> curr)
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (curr == n)
    {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span><span class="hljs-comment">; i &lt; a.length; i++)</span>
        {
            pw.println(a[i])<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        }
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>[] <span class="hljs-keyword">next</span> = new <span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>[a.length * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>]<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span><span class="hljs-comment">; i &lt; a.length; i++)</span>
        {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">next</span>[i] = a[i] + <span class="hljs-string">"0"</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">next</span>[<span class="hljs-keyword">next</span>.length - i - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = a[i] + <span class="hljs-string">"1"</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        }
        add(<span class="hljs-keyword">next</span>, n, pw, curr + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s the driver code for this method</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> n = Integer.<span class="hljs-built_in">parseInt</span>(st.nextToken());
add(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">String</span>[]{<span class="hljs-string">"0"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"1"</span>}, n, pw, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
